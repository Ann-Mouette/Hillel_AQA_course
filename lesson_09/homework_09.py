Homework â„–9.

Task 01.

we have two lists with equal or different size
ex. l1=[1,3,5,7]  l2=[1,4,5]
task:
create list that will store such values
ex. list_target = [(1,1), (3,4), (5,5), (7,0)]
zero (0) is our default value that we set if no such
element by index was found in certain list.
code should work and vise versa
ex. l1=[1,4,5] l2=[1,3,5,7] input data should produce
ex. list_target = [(1,1), (4,3), (5,5), (0,7)]
your solution should include comprehension constructions
Advices:
set of (list1 indexes union list2 indexes) could be helpful
to get larger indexes scope ( or use if-else)
dict as you remember has default value if key was not found
ex. d1.get(key, 0)

    """
    Merge two lists.

    Parameters:
    list1 (list): The first list of elements.
    list2 (list): The second list of elements.

    Returns:
    list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of elements
    from list1 and list2 at the same index. If one list is shorter,
    0 is used as the default for the missing values.
